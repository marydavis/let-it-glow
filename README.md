## Intro to an Arduino project (using Elegoo Super Starter Kit)
[![Waffle.io - Columns and their card count](https://badge.waffle.io/marydavis/let-it-glow.svg?columns=all)](https://waffle.io/marydavis/let-it-glow)

### Setup
  1. [Download IDE](https://www.elegoo.com/download/)
  
  1. [Download Elegoo Super Starter Kit Tutorial](https://www.elegoo.com/tutorial/Elegoo%20Super%20Starter%20Kit%20for%20UNO%20V1.0.2017.10.31.zip)
  
  1. Install the IDE

### Let's make sure it works
  1. Take the Elegoo Uno R3 board out of bottom left section. *(I keep my antistatic bag for storage)*
  1. Take the blue USB cable out of the top section.
  1. Plug your board into your computer using the cable.
  1. Your board should have a solid green and a solid orange light on it.
  1. Open the Arduiono IDE.
  1. Confirm board setup, click `Tools` in the top toolbar which should include the below:
     * `Board: Arduino/Genuino Uno` - if not, select it from the list.
     * `Port: Arduino/Genuino Uno` - don't worry if it has other information too, just make sure it has the board in it.
 
  1. Next, click `File` in the top toolbar.
  1. Open the Blink example by going to `Examples -> 01.Basics -> Blink`.
  1. Click the ➡️(right arrow) for Upload, it is next to the check mark above the "Blink" tab name.
  1. You should see it sending information in the console at the bottom of the screen and several lights flashing on your board.
  1. Now you should see the orange light on your board flashing every 1 second. 
  
  **If so, you are ready for the project!**
